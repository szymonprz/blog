## Why I started this?

These are the main reasons:

- I know that no one is going to read this, so it can be my little personal knowledge base
- But if you're reading this (hello stranger :wave:), I am going to share with you some quick tips, what I'm doing while making software to do it easier and faster
- Here I'm going to learn how to write something what for others, and by this I mean how to structure/organize and write my toughts on "paper" that they can be read and understood by others


And that's all for this post. I hope that I will maintain this for a little longer than previous blog, which lasted two months. See you soon... :crossed_fingers:
